# Managing-Operations-Analysis
Data Analysis for graduate student in undergraduate class

In an undergrduate class, Managing Operations, as a graduate student, I was required to do extra work under my concentration.  In this school my major is Information Systems and Decision Sciences(ISDS) which relates to big data.  My choice was to look at the dataset of a companies' operation and answer the questions of What made a company perform well and why the company performed well.  The biggest hurdle to this was obtaining a dataset from a company and after communictating back and forth with my professor, the biggest problem that seemed to be present was finding operations data on a company that was public.  The only way to really obtain private data was to be on the inside of the company.  I had reached out to various companies such as a car wash company that was building multiple new automated car wash stations in the area and their Chief of Operations was not able to divulge that information.  My last resort which the professor agreed with was using ChatGPT to generate a fictional dataset.  Simultaneously, ChatGPT also generated its own report that was password locked specifically so that my professor can read it as a sort of answer key to the report.
